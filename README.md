MATLAB|MATLAB|MathsWorks

**Pros:**
  - You'll understand the basics of MATLAB + programming thoroughly. This is from handling variables, making tables, visualising data with simple graphs and charts.
  - Short course time (2~3 days)
  - No pre-requisites required

**Cons:**
  - Contents can get quite boring.
  - You need an academic license to take this course freely. 

**My comments:**
  - It's boring so I took 1-2 weeks to complete the course.
  - After this course, I soon integrated OpenCV with MATLAB and then carried out all experiments needed for my master's thesis.

**Pros:**
  - Only covers important topics - so it doesn't waste your time.
  - Takes 1-2 hours to finish the entire course.
  - No pre-requisites required
  - Freely available!

**Cons:**
  - Only covers important topics - if you are a beginner, you won't be able to code straight after this course.
  - You need an academic license to take this course freely. 

**My comments:**
  - I say if you need to refresh yourself a MATLAB coding knowledge, this is perfect for you.

Python|Carnegie Mellon University|  |

**Pros:**
  - Freely available! (Although the video capture of the lecture is not available)
  - Tutorials and homeworks are there to boost your skills.
  - No pre-requisites required

**Cons:**
  - Video capture of the lecture is not available.
  - If you follow the course, you'll be guided to use Pyzo for the IDE. There are better IDEs out there (Personal opinion). 
  - Lack of interactive tutorial.
 
**My comments:**
  - I say if you are an absolute beginner in programming, even if you are trying to learn Python, go take the MATLAB tutorial by MathsWorks. This is because MATLAB tutorial teaches the basics of programming more thoroughly than this tutorial (personal opinion). It will be much easier and faster going through this Python lecture if you understand the basics of programming, so it will be benefical in overall time efficiency.

**Pros:**
  - Very good explanations!
  - Fast paced
  - You can actually see the code running in Jupyter Notebook

**Cons:**
  - You need to pay (but personally I think it is worth the price with a discount.
 
**My comments:**
  - I originally took this course hoping to see a fast-paced PyTorch course, but I stayed for Python / numpy crash course. Easily the fastest, while containing the essential information to start working on PyTorch. Pre-requisites include basic understanding in programming like variables, for-loops, while-loops etc - in which people generally start programming by learning Python first, so I don't think this is applicable for many people out there (maybe for engineers who started programming with MATLAB, or computer scientists with Java/Javascript?)

**My comments:**
  - I myself is actually pretty new to using command line in ubuntu. I knew how to navigate, open, install, uninstall stuffs... but I didn't know how to edit things within the command line using Vim. This tutorial may be useful if you consider yourself as a 'definitely-not-an-expert in command lines'.

**Pros:**
  - Well-structured contents
  - Very friendly explanation

**Cons:**
  - No real-life examples
  - 3 hours and 46 minutes in a single video? 100% I won't get bored ;)
  - A little too basic content, and not-so-fast-paced.
 
**My comments:**
  - The 3 hours and 46 minutes runtime may scare you, and yes, I felt the same. The way I took this course is by just watching the video before sleep, sometimes just for 5 minutes, sometimes for an hour. I didn't really like sit down and dig through it, but that is also one way to do it. The impression of this course to me is that it can be better packed - the content structure is very good, but it is at the most basic level and does not empower the student to carry out an individual project with confidence. This may be the perfect course if you just wanna learn how to read C code written by someone, but definitely not for someone who wishes to dig into C language.

**My comments:**
  - Tell me lots of cool-sounding C++ terminologies, and then **DON'T** explain it! That's what this course does exactly. I think the content is actually very useful, but only to those who can understand those terminologies. Many other audience seem to feel the same way as me - the audience forum is pretty much dead, especially after the 1st or the 2nd lecture. It's the only C++ course I took so far, so I cannot judge yet how good the content actually is... but definitely won't recommend it to someone who wishes to learn C++.

**My comments:**
  - My honest opinion is that this is **not** the best way to learn linear algebra, but **is** the best way to revisit linear algebra. If you need to learn linear algebra from scratch, then this video series will only be 2~3 stars.

**My comments:** Generally I am finding the course structure very well made! I am currently taking week 4 materials before anything since it is related to my work. The lecturer talks a bit too slow, and some of the mathematical notations are hard to follow for me (but this is subjective, as it depends on preferences on vector dimensions).

# Books read

## Machine Learning

<br>

1. **"Python for Data Analysis - Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy and IPython"** by William McKinney ([O'Reily Website](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do)) :star::star::star::star:

> A good book to learn NumPy, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook (IPython), matplotlib. If you prefer books over online MOOCS, then I say this is the one to go for.

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

This book is essential for those who have just learned Python programming language, and is willing to learn data science in the future. A well-structured, clean data is key for a good data science practice, which this book provides a great introduction and practice samples using NumPy and Pandas libraries. This book also covers other libraries that helps in understanding the data and manipulating them, using Jupyter Notebook (IPython) and matplotlib for visualisation.

</p>
</details>
</br>

2. **"Deep Learning"** by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville ([Website](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)) :star::star::star::star::star:

> The level of maths in this book is controversially hard. If you don't have much maths background, then go study maths first. If you are okay with the maths, then this book is **highly recommended**. 

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

Generally, there are two types of opinions towards this book. The first is that this book is very informative and useful for anyone who wishes to study deep learning properly. The second is that this book has been recommended too much that it is almost cliche. Personally I cannot agree with these two statements anymore, because they are both correct. This book provides a very good overview of essential mathematics behind deep learning techniques. The concepts of techniques are very well explained in words. However, a good understanding of mathematics is required to fully understand the contents. For someone like me who comes from a non-computer-science background, I needed another entry-level book to follow.

</p>
</details>
</br>


2. **"Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning"** by Christopher M. Bishop (Currently reading) ([pdf 2006](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf)) :star::star::star::star:

> I'll say this book is only recommended for researchers in machine learning field. It is quite maths-heavy, as it is intended to be so.  But with this book only, you can still cover most of maths needed for classical machine learning methods. 

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

A very detailed explanation of the mathematics behind machine learning techniques. Unlike other popular deep learning books, this book does not focus on specific techniques or applications of deep learning, but rather, it attempts to cover as many machine learning techniques which is not restricted to deep learning. The pre-requisite knowledge is substantial, and a good focus is required to follow its content for a general student like me. Personally, I feel like a mathematics major should not find it too difficult to follow. Although I am only half-way through, I can tell for sure that this book is one of the most informative books out in the market.

3. **Chinese AI textbook for high school** ([Related News](https://www.shine.cn/news/metro/1804293918/)) :star::star::star::star::star:

> If you can get your hands on it + if you can read mandarin, then this is the best introduction for deep learning. 

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

I doubt there is a translated version out there... but I was able to see its content with a help from a Chinese lab mate. This book covers the history of machine learning and deep learning techniques, of which the explanation is arguably better than other textbooks or review papers out there. The textbook is very well structured, while being visually clear and self-explanatory, and is able to describe the machine learning techniques with only high school mathematics (e.g. vectors). The textbook shines where it explores into different applications of deep learning, which it is very effective in insipiring high school students to study deep learning in a specific field (e.g. NLP, vision).

4. **"イラストで学ぶ ディープラーニング"** ("그림과 수식으로 배우는 통통 딥러닝") by Yamashita Takayoshi ([Original Japanese book](https://www.kspub.co.jp/book/detail/1538252.html), [Korean book](http://www.kyobobook.co.kr/product/detailViewKor.laf?mallGb=KOR&ejkGb=KOR&barcode=9791185890944)):star::star::star::star:

> The contents are a bit outdated, but it can still serve as a not-too-bad introduction to deep learning. It is short - so it will save time if anyone here is after that.

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

The content of this book may be a bit old - it does not cover new methodologies like GAN that was introduced in 2015. The content of the book was very similar to other review papers out there. However, this book shines at where it needs to explain the mathematics - personally, the backpropagation section was very useful to me, as it explained the mathematical steps which can considerably long, but it explains very well with patience. The Korean translation version seems to over-translate some phrases, such as 'auto-encoder' into '자기부호화기', which in fact makes the understanding of the content harder.

</p>
</details>
</br>

5. **"딥러닝 첫걸음" & "신경망 첫걸음"** :star::star::star:

> If you feel uncomfortable reading texts in English (or rather, you only find comfortable reading in Korean), then this book may be a good introduction to deep learning.

<details><summary>Expand</summary>

Easy introduction to deep learning and neural networks. Only recommended if the reader is not comfortable in reading text in English. Otherwise, I recommended other books or courses to save time.

## Robotics and Computer Vision

<br>

1. **"Modern Robotics: Mechanics, Planning and Control"** by Kevin M. Lynch and Frank C. Park ([Pre-Print pdf](http://hades.mech.northwestern.edu/images/7/7f/MR.pdf), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Robotics-Mechanics-Planning-Control/dp/1107156300), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/modernrobotics)) :star::star::star::star::star:

> If you ever get stuck in understanding advanced robotics concepts in academic research papers, or may need to lead yourself into a deeper understanding of fundamental concepts within robotics... here it is :)

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

I've only read this book on Kinematics section (Chapter 4-6), therefore remains in 'books to be read' section. What I like most about this book is that it uses a modern notations and representations of the mathematics required for it. This aspect of the book allows a easy and fast understanding of the subject - personally, I found it more intuitive and easier to understand than the textbook written by Saeed Niku. However, the downside may be the mismatch of the notations and representations from old books or journals.

</p>
</details>
</br>

2. **"Computer Vision - Algorithms and Application"** - by Richard Szeliski ([pdf](http://szeliski.org/Book/drafts/SzeliskiBook_20100903_draft.pdf)) :star::star::star::star::star:

> I've always felt that online computer vision courses only focus on implementation. There are 'some' online courses that focus on the theory, but these are mostly on advanced concepts like SLAM. Yes, we work mostly on implementation, and yes this way we get more students and money - but really, people need to be aware that understanding the background of each techniques in computer vision is essential for performance optimisation. How many times do we see people blindly using SIFT/SURF for feature detection? How many times do we see people blindly using YOLO for the simplest detection tasks? We need to understand what methods are available out there, what their pros/cons are, and why they have such properties. Obviously reading papers on each techniques will be the most informative, but it consumes too much time, so this book has summarised all the important information of traditional computer vision techniques.

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

A collection of computer vision / image processing algorithms! Despite convolutional neural network is getting the spotlight in academia and industry in computer vision field nowadays, the fundamental knowledge and skills in image processing and general computer vision techniques must not be underestimated. Such techniques include stereo-correspondences, image stitching, feature extraction, structure from motion, and 3D reconstruction. These techinques, together with CNN, has a great potential to make useful computer vision applications. Therefore this book is highly recommended to anyone who only has worked on CNN in computer vision area.

## Quality Engineering

<br>

1. **"Six Sigma and the Quality Toolbox"** by John Bicheno and Philip Catherwood ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Six-SIGMA-Quality-Toolbox-Manufacturing/dp/0954124421/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8)) :star::star::star::star::star:

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>

Six Sigma is an engineering philosophy that focuses on achieving the outcome of any processes just as what the customer wants - in numeric measures, it aims to achieve 3.8 defects per million opportunities, by utilising well-established techniques that can be utilised in industry and potentially in research as well. **This book is like a bible to me**. The flow of content is very intuitive and easy to read, even for non process engineering specialists. The reader can fish out useful techniques from the book, and may attempt to apply directly to the current research. I have done this on both my bachelor's and master's thesis - I have used Ishikawa Diagram for cause analysis, and investigating engineering requirement of my system development using Quality Function Deployment. The book does not give details in industry standard, however, it gives a good start point in understanding the importance of quality in both industrial production and scientific research.

<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>
A great book about probabilistic methods in robotics, mostly focusing on state estimation and bayes filters. Therefore this book provides a solid foundation in understanding commonly used tracking filters such as Kalman filters, particle filters. The content also extends a bit futher to advanced modern concepts, such as mobile robot localistion and SLAM.
