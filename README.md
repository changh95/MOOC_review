# Study Resource Review

This respository contains:
* Personal reviews of popular MOOCs and books
* Personal study plans

The choices of MOOCs and books are based on my interests: Computer Vision, Robotics, Deep Learning.
But they may not necessarily be under these topics.

# Courses and MOOCs taken

## Programming

1. MATLAB Fundamentals

MATLAB|MATLAB|[Link](https://www.mathworks.com/training-schedule/matlab-fundamentals.html)

A great introduction to MATLAB programming. Through interactive web programming you will understand the basics of MATLAB programming, from handling variables, making tables, visualising data with simple graphs and charts. No pre-requisites are required for the course, however, you may need an academic license for MATLAB due to its cost (Free with academic license). The course is constructed to be completed in 2~3 days, but the content is quite boring so I took about 1-2 weeks. This is the only course I have taken for my master's thesis - with introduction to MATLAB programming, I soon integrated OpenCV onto MATLAB and did a computer vision related project.

2. Shervine Amidi's MATLAB tutorials

Github|Shervine Amidi (Stanford)|[Link](https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/common/matlab-start)

A MATLAB tutorial that will take maximum 1 hour even for a beginner. Only recommended for absolute beginners, or someone who needs a refresher in MATLAB after having not programmed for a long time.

## Quality Engineering

1. "Six Sigma and the Quality Toolbox" by John Bicheno and Philip Catherwood

[Link](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Six-SIGMA-Quality-Toolbox-Manufacturing/dp/0954124421/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8)

Six Sigma is an engineering philosophy that focuses on achieving the outcome of any processes just as what the customer wants - in numeric measures, it aims to achieve 3.8 defects per million opportunities, by utilising well-established techniques that can be utilised in industry and potentially in research as well. **This book is like a bible to me**. The flow of content is very intuitive and easy to read, even for non process engineering specialists. The reader can fish out useful techniques from the book, and may attempt to apply directly to the current research. I have done this on both my bachelor's and master's thesis - I have used Ishikawa Diagram for cause analysis, and investigating engineering requirement of my system development using Quality Function Deployment. The book does not give details in industry standard, however, it gives a good start point in understanding the importance of quality in both industrial production and scientific research.

# Courses / MOOCS to be taken

## Mathematics

1. "Mathematics for Machine Learning : Linear Algebra"

Platform|Author|url
--|--|--
Coursera|Imperial College London|[Link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning)

Recommended by many students at Imperial College and StackOverflow. Apparently this course is perfect to harden the knowledge of linear algebra.

2. "Probabilistic Systems Analysis and Applied Probability", 6.041 / 6.431 Fall 2010

Platform|Author|url
--|--|--
MIT OpenCourseware|Prof. John Tsitsiklis|[Link](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-041-probabilistic-systems-analysis-and-applied-probability-fall-2010/)

Recommended by some Korean deep learning researchers. The course seems a bit old - may be replaced by other new courses if better ones are found.

3. Calculus, Statistics and Algebra by "Professor Leonard"

Platform|Author|url
--|--|--
Youtube|Professor Leonard|[Link](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoHhuummRZaIVX7bD4t2czg)

Video playlists made by a youtuber. Very good at explanation, however I'm not yet sure if these can be useful for machine learning.

Stanford:
Linear algebra - Math104, Math 113, CS205
Probability theory - CS109 or Stats116

## Programming

1. CMU 15-112 "Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science"

--|--|--
MIT OpenCourseware|Jesse Dunietz|[Link](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-096-introduction-to-c-january-iap-2011/)

Quite an old resource - may not cover C++11 or C++14. Need to check.

4. Introduction to Linux
