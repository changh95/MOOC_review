# Study Resource Review

This respository contains:
* Personal reviews of popular MOOCs and books
* Personal study plans

The choices of MOOCs and books are based on my interests: Computer Vision, Robotics, Deep Learning.
But they may not necessarily be under these topics.

# Courses and MOOCs taken

## Programming

1. (MATLAB) MATLAB Fundamentals

Platform|Author|url
--|--|--
MATLAB|MathsWorks|[Link](https://www.mathworks.com/training-schedule/matlab-fundamentals.html)

A great introduction to MATLAB programming. Through interactive web programming you will understand the basics of MATLAB programming, from handling variables, making tables, visualising data with simple graphs and charts. No pre-requisites are required for the course, however, you may need an academic license for MATLAB due to its cost (Free with academic license). The course is constructed to be completed in 2~3 days, but the content is quite boring so I took about 1-2 weeks. This is the only course I have taken for my master's thesis - with introduction to MATLAB programming, I soon integrated OpenCV onto MATLAB and did a computer vision related project.

2. (MATLAB) Shervine Amidi's MATLAB tutorials

Platform|Author|url
--|--|--
Github|Shervine Amidi (Stanford)|[Link](https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/common/matlab-start)

A MATLAB tutorial that will take maximum 1 hour even for a beginner. Only recommended for absolute beginners, or someone who needs a refresher in MATLAB after having not programmed for a long time.

3. (Python) CMU 15-112 "Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science" (Fall '18)

Platform|Author|url
--|--|--
Carnegie Mellon University|  |[Link](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/)

A very well constructed introduction to Python programming, as well as to general programming languages. Since this is a proper university lecture content, it comprises of tutorials and homeworks. For anyone with previous programming experience, this course can be taken through very fast. You can still take this course without a previous programmning experience, but I recommend taking MATLAB tutorial first, because the MATLAB tutorial is superior in teaching the basics of programming thoroughly.

4. (UNIX) Introduction to Linux

# Books read

## Programming

1. "Python for Data Analysis - Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy and IPython" by William McKinney

O'Reily Website [Link](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do)

This book is essential for those who have just learned Python programming language, and is willing to learn data science in the future. A well-structured, clean data is key for a good data science practice, which this book provides a great introduction and practice samples using NumPy and Pandas libraries. This book also covers other libraries that helps in understanding the data and manipulating them, using Jupyter Notebook (IPython) and matplotlib for visualisation.

## Robotics

1. "Modern Robotics: Mechanics, Planning and Control" by Kevin M. Lynch and Frank C. Park

Pre-Print [Link](http://hades.mech.northwestern.edu/images/7/7f/MR.pdf)

Amazon [Link](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Robotics-Mechanics-Planning-Control/dp/1107156300)

Coursera [Link](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/modernrobotics)

I've only read this book on Kinematics section (Chapter 4-6), therefore remains in 'books to be read' section. What I like most about this book is that it uses a modern notations and representations of the mathematics required for it. This aspect of the book allows a easy and fast understanding of the subject - personally, I found it more intuitive and easier to understand than the textbook written by Saeed Niku. However, the downside may be the mismatch of the notations and representations from old books or journals.

## Computer Vision

1. "Computer Vision - Algorithms and Application" - by Richard Szeliski

pdf [Link](http://szeliski.org/Book/drafts/SzeliskiBook_20100903_draft.pdf)

A collection of computer vision / image processing algorithms! Despite convolutional neural network is getting the spotlight in academia and industry in computer vision field nowadays, the fundamental knowledge and skills in image processing and general computer vision techniques must not be underestimated. Such techniques include stereo-correspondences, image stitching, feature extraction, structure from motion, and 3D reconstruction. These techinques, together with CNN, has a great potential to make useful computer vision applications. Therefore this book is highly recommended to anyone who only has worked on CNN in computer vision area.


## Quality Engineering

1. "Six Sigma and the Quality Toolbox" by John Bicheno and Philip Catherwood

Amazon [Link](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Six-SIGMA-Quality-Toolbox-Manufacturing/dp/0954124421/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8)

Six Sigma is an engineering philosophy that focuses on achieving the outcome of any processes just as what the customer wants - in numeric measures, it aims to achieve 3.8 defects per million opportunities, by utilising well-established techniques that can be utilised in industry and potentially in research as well. **This book is like a bible to me**. The flow of content is very intuitive and easy to read, even for non process engineering specialists. The reader can fish out useful techniques from the book, and may attempt to apply directly to the current research. I have done this on both my bachelor's and master's thesis - I have used Ishikawa Diagram for cause analysis, and investigating engineering requirement of my system development using Quality Function Deployment. The book does not give details in industry standard, however, it gives a good start point in understanding the importance of quality in both industrial production and scientific research.

## Mathematics

1. "Mathematics for Machine Learning : Linear Algebra"

Platform|Author|url
--|--|--
Coursera|Imperial College London|[Link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning)

Recommended by many students at Imperial College and StackOverflow. Apparently this course is perfect to harden the knowledge of linear algebra.

2. "Probabilistic Systems Analysis and Applied Probability", 6.041 / 6.431 Fall 2010

Platform|Author|url
--|--|--
MIT OpenCourseware|Prof. John Tsitsiklis|[Link](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-041-probabilistic-systems-analysis-and-applied-probability-fall-2010/)

Recommended by some Korean deep learning researchers. The course seems a bit old - may be replaced by other new courses if better ones are found.

3. Calculus, Statistics and Algebra by "Professor Leonard"

Platform|Author|url
--|--|--
Youtube|Professor Leonard|[Link](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoHhuummRZaIVX7bD4t2czg)

Video playlists made by a youtuber. Very good at explanation, however I'm not yet sure if these can be useful for machine learning.

Other sources: 
Stanford:
Linear algebra - Math104, Math 113, CS205
Probability theory - CS109 or Stats116
